### About challenge and solution
The challenge suggested that we create iframes for ads on Brellaâ€™s web page. We came up with 6 creative options. They are suppose to attract users attention and retention rate. These 2 things are crucial for ads.

Most of our iframes are playable. Some of them interact with each other. Owing to that we hope that it will improve user experience and in future they will be more inclined to interact with ads. We would consider it a success if our ads will not trigger the feeling of irritation.

Here's a few ideas:

Give user an opportunity to solve some simple puzzle. To get some promocode or gift from a sponsor. For example this one: https://kukinpower.github.io/junction-connected-2020/index.html.
Have fun with interactive elements like these: https://kukinpower.github.io/junction-connected-2020/balls/index.html
